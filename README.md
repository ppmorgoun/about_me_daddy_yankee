### About this app
The purpose of this app is to accelerate my learning of Kotlin and the Android app development. This app illustrates:
 - The use of view bindings and data bindings to improve performance, and seperate data from the presentation
 - Stlying textviews and buttons, and experimenting with attributes such as padding, margins, gravity, and more
